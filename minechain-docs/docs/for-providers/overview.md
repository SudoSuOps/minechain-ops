# For Providers

Build your GPU infrastructure business. Own your portfolio.

## The Infrastructure Model

**You Own:**
- GPU portfolio (your fleet)
- Business operations
- Tenant relationships
- Pricing strategy
- Your reputation

**You Pay:**
- $49/month broker desk fee to MineChain
- Infrastructure costs (power, cooling, bandwidth)

**You Keep:**
- 100% of lease revenue
- Full control of your portfolio
- All business upside

## Business Model

Like real estate brokers paying desk fees while keeping 100% commission - compute providers pay platform access and retain all lease income.

Your infrastructure success is your success.

## Portfolio Requirements

**Minimum Hardware:**
- NVIDIA RTX 5070 or higher (5080, 5090, 4090, 4080)
- 32GB+ RAM per node (64GB recommended)
- 1TB+ NVMe SSD
- Fiber internet (500+ Mbps symmetric, 1Gbps preferred)
- Modern 8+ core CPU

**Infrastructure:**
- 99%+ uptime commitment
- Professional cooling and power
- Remote monitoring capability
- Backup systems

**No Junk:**
- No mining-degraded cards
- No consumer-grade components below spec
- No phantom inventory
- Professional operators only

## Earnings Model

**Example: 1x RTX 5090 @ $1.50/hour**

- 50% occupancy (12 hrs/day): $540/month - $49 = **$491 net**
- 70% occupancy (17 hrs/day): $765/month - $49 = **$716 net**
- 90% occupancy (22 hrs/day): $990/month - $49 = **$941 net**

ROI typically 6-12 months depending on hardware cost.
