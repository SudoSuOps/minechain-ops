# How MineChain Works

## Three-Party Model

**Providers** - Infrastructure owners with GPU portfolios

**Tenants** - End-users leasing compute

**Broker (MineChain)** - Marketplace infrastructure

## Net Lease Structure

**Provider:**
- Owns portfolio
- Sets lease terms
- Manages occupancy
- Covers infrastructure costs (power, cooling, bandwidth)
- Keeps 100% of lease revenue

**Tenant:**
- Pays lease rate
- Gets SLA guarantees
- Payment held in escrow
- 24-hour minimum lease

**Broker:**
- Provides marketplace
- Manages escrow (USDC on Base L2)
- Enforces SLA
- Charges $49/month provider desk fee

## Key Differences

**Traditional Platforms:**
- Take 20-30% of every transaction
- Hide infrastructure owners
- Pay in tokens (immediate dumps)
- Phantom inventory (claim 6000 nodes, 10% work)

**MineChain:**
- Flat $49/month (predictable costs)
- Transparent provider portfolios
- USDC escrow (real money)
- Quality over quantity (verified infrastructure only)

## Business Metrics

- **Portfolio** - Provider's GPU fleet
- **Occupancy** - Utilization rate
- **Turnover** - Tenant churn rate
- **Terms** - SLA and lease conditions
- **Escrow** - Payment protection mechanism

## Coming Soon: Sales Agents

**Three-sided marketplace:**

- **Providers** - own infrastructure
- **Tenants** - lease compute
- **Sales Agents** - bring enterprise deals, earn commission (10-15% of first 3-6 months)

Providers still keep 100% of lease revenue. Agents earn on top for bringing business.
