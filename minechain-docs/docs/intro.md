# Welcome to MineChain

**Real Compute. Real People. Real Infrastructure.**

MineChain is different. We're not big tech with phantom node counts. We're not a token with chart-watching degens. We're bare metal operators who actually run the hardware - and we let providers keep 100% of what they earn.

## The Problem with "Decentralized" Compute

Most platforms claim 6000 nodes but 10% actually work. Providers get paid in tokens they dump immediately to cover costs. Nobody knows who's behind the hardware. Support is a black hole.

That's not decentralized. That's just inefficient centralization with extra steps.

## The MineChain Model

We borrowed from real estate: the **Remax model for compute**.

Real estate brokers pay desk fees (~$500-1000/month) and keep 100% of commission. They own their business, set their rates, build their brand. The brokerage provides infrastructure, marketing, and clients.

**For compute providers on MineChain:**
- Pay $49/month platform fee
- Keep 100% of rental revenue
- Set your own rates
- Get your own provider homepage showcasing your fleet
- Access to our marketing team driving customers
- Real community in Discord/GitHub

**For renters:**
- Browse actual provider profiles with verified hardware
- See real uptime stats, not marketing fluff
- Choose providers based on specs, reputation, pricing
- Talk to real humans when you need support
- Pay in USDC on Base L2 - no tokens, no charts

## Provider Homepages

Every provider gets their own page:
- `minechain.ai/providers/your-name`
- Showcase your fleet (specs, capabilities)
- Display your uptime and performance stats
- Set your rates and availability
- Build your reputation with renter reviews
- Link your GitHub, Discord, social presence

**You own your business. We bring the customers.**

## Quality Over Quantity

We don't inflate numbers. Every provider is vetted:
- **Minimum specs:** RTX 5070+ GPU, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe, fiber internet
- **Real hardware checks:** We verify before you go live
- **Uptime commitments:** 99%+ or you're off the network
- **No junk rigs:** No mining cards, no frankenstein builds

14 solid nodes beats 6000 ghost rigs every time.

## Getting Started

**Rent Compute:**
- Browse providers and their rates
