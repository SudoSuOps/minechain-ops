# Welcome to MineChain

**Real Compute. Real Infrastructure. Real Business.**

MineChain is a Web3 compute broker connecting providers (infrastructure owners) with tenants (end-users) through transparent lease agreements.

## The Model

**Providers (Infrastructure Owners):**
- Own GPU portfolio (your fleet)
- Pay $49/month broker desk fee
- Keep 100% of lease revenue
- Set your own terms
- Manage occupancy rates

**Tenants (Customers):**
- Lease GPU compute with clear terms
- 24-hour minimum lease
- Payment held in escrow (USDC on Base L2)
- Transparent SLA

**MineChain (Broker):**
- Provides marketplace infrastructure
- Manages escrow and settlements
- Enforces SLA
- No rev-share, just desk fees

## Net Lease Structure

- Tenant pays compute rate
- Provider covers power, cooling, bandwidth
- Broker provides marketplace infrastructure

## Key Metrics

- **Portfolio** - Your GPU fleet
- **Occupancy** - Utilization rate (target: 70%+)
- **Turnover** - Tenant rotation rate
- **Terms** - SLA and lease conditions

No tokens. No charts. Just infrastructure business.
